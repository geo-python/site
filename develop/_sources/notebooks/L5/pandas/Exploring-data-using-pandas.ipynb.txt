    "Reading data files using Pandas will make life a bit easier compared to the traditional Python way of reading data files.\n",

    "    - OR you can download the data file from this link (TODO CHECK LINK!)\n",
    "    - The data file contains observed daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures from June 2016 recorded from the Kumpula weather observation station in Helsinki.\n",
    "    - The data has been derived from a data file of daily temperature measurments downloaded from the [US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information climate database](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/).\n",

    "So, what happened? Why did the dataframe look weird before we skipped the first rows? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the file data was read into a Pandas **DataFrame**, which is  a two-dimensional structure used for storing table-like data. A pandas dataframe contains a collection of columns, which can all be a different value type (string, float, int, boolean, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first attempt to read data from the text file, the first rows containing metadata did not belong to the actual data array, and that's why the output looked weird.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, one of the neat things in Pandas is that that DataFrames have labelled axes (rows and columns).  For our example, we have the rows labeled with an index value (``0`` to ``29``), and columns labelled ``YEARMODA``, ``TEMP``, ``MAX``, and ``MIN``. This is nice because we can easily use these labels to divide up our data and make interacting with it easier as you'll see later in the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example above, trying to read a datafile with some header text (the metadata in this case), is *very* common. Reading data into Pandas is pretty easy, but **it helps to have a sense of what the datafile looks like before you try to read it**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge can also be that large datafiles might not nicely print on screen using the ``print()``-function so it might be better to look at only the top 5-10 lines of the file rather than loading the entire thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**We can  use ``pandas.DataFrame.head`` -function to quickly check the contents of the dataframe.** This function returns the first n rows for the dataframe. By default, it gives 5 first rows."
