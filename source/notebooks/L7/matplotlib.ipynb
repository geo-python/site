    "As we're now familiar with some of the features of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), we will wade into visualizing our data in Python using the built-in plotting options available directly in pandas. Much like the case of pandas being built upon [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), plotting in pandas takes advantage of plotting features from the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) plotting library. Plotting in pandas provides a basic framework for visualizing our data, but as you'll see we will sometimes need to also use features from Matplotlib to enhance our plots. In particular, we will use features from the the `pyplot` module in Matplotlib, which provides [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)-like plotting.\n",

    "Toward the end of the lesson we will also briefly explore creating interactive plots using the [Pandas-Bokeh](https://github.com/PatrikHlobil/Pandas-Bokeh) plotting backend, which allows us to produce plots similar to those available in the [Bokeh plotting library](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html) using plotting syntax similar to that used normally in pandas. This is an optional part of the lesson, but will allow you to see an example for further exploration of interactive plotting using Pandas-Bokeh."

Bar plots are one option, which can be used quite similarly to line plots with the addition of the `kind=bar` parameter. Note that it is easiest to plot our selected time range for a bar plot by selecting the dates in our data series first, rather than adjusting the plot limits. pandas sees bar plot data as categorical, so the date range is more difficult to define for x-axis limits. For the y-axis, we can still define its range using the `ylim=[ymin, ymax]` parameter. Similarly, text placement on a bar plot is more difficult, and most easily done using the index value of the bar where the text should be placed."

    "## Saving your plots as image files\n",
    "\n",
    "Saving plots created using pandas can be done in several ways. The recommendation for use outside of Jupyter notebooks is to use Matplotlib's `plt.savefig()` function. When using `plt.savefig()`, you simply give a list of commands to generate a plot and include `plt.savefig()` with some parameters as the last command in the Python cell. The file name is required, and the image format will be determined based on the listed file extension. Note that because we have not used Matplotlib for any of the earlier plots, we need to import it here first.\n",

    "Matplotlib plots can be saved in a number of useful file formats, including PNG, PDF, and EPS. PNG is a nice format for raster images, and EPS is probably easiest to use for vector graphics. Let's check out an example and save our lovely bar plot."
