    "\n",
    "Good question. First off, if you want to update individual values in a list you're likely going to need to loop that includes the index values. There are functions such as `enumerate()` that can help, but their use can be somewhat confusing for new programmers. Second, in cases where you have multiple lists that are related to one another, it can be handy to use a loop with the index values to be able to access corresponding locations in each list. For this, let's consider an example with the two lists below."
