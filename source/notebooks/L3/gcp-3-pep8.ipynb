[Coding conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_conventions) are a set of generally agreed ways of writing programming code in a specific programming language. Coding conventions help programmers to write code that is consistent and easy to read. Consistency and readability are important for sharing your code with others, and also for helping your own brain to follow along!\n",
