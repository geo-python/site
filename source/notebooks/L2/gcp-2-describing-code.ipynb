    "# GCP 2 - Describing your code\n",
    "\n",
    "This week our good programming practice is about describing your code. What we mean here is providing some descriptive text that helps the user (you in many cases) understand what the code is used for, and how certain sections work. In a Jupyter notebook, this text can take two basic forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code comments**: Text included within a code cell to help the user understand what the code is doing\n",
    "- **Markdown text**: Text in Markdown cells that provides a broader view of the code or analysis that follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll provide examples of both below, along with some tips."

    "\n",
    "Providing comments or Markdown text to describe your code is essential for a number of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code descriptions make it easier to understand your code**. Although {doc}`good variable names<gcp-1-variable-naming.ipynb>` can help you and other users better understand what you code does, your Jupyter notebooks are seldom short enough for you to be able to read over the entire code at once and fully understand what is going on. For this reason, comments and Markdown text are essential parts of making sure your notebooks are easy to use and understand section by section.\n",
    "2. **Code descriptions make it easier for other users to use your code**. Even when writing simple software it is worthwhile to take the time to include some extra documentaion about how it works. Everyone has their own tendencies in how they write their software and by including a few comments and/or Markdown text you can make it much easier for people to understand and use your work.\n",
    "3. **Writing code descriptions can help you debug your code**. We'll all soon have more experience with not knowing why some piece of code doesn't work the way it should. One way to help fix (or debug) your code is to add comments stating what each line does. By taking things step by step, you may find that your code doesn't actually do what you thought, and fix issues in this way.\n",
    "4. **Code descriptions are a big part of why Jupyter notebooks are so powerful**. Code comments are quite helpful in general, but the biggest feature of a Jupyter notebook is the ability to mix rich text with your code. With this platform you can even write scientific texts with embedded code cells to be able to perform calculations, analyze data and visualize your results. This powerful platform is an excellent open science tool that provides a clear means to reproduce your results on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we review the main forms of code descriptions we'll use in our Jupyter notebooks."

    "\n",
    "Yes, yes it does. But don't listen to everything you find on the Internet (except this, listen to this...).\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact of the matter is that programmers advocate people should not need to comment their code if it is easily understood. In essence, the argument is that if you need comments to understand what the code does, it isn't good code. They don't say you should never comment in your code, but rather that comments are really only needed to describe why something is done a given way (not what is done). While this is true to a degree, this advice doesn't apply to most of us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of us are only just getting started with programming, and our comments serve a bit different purpose. For us, comments make sure we understand what each line of our code does, and help the graders follow your thinking in the code in cases when you take a different path than expected to solve a given problem. In addition, the comments make you pause, look at your code, and then come up with a way to describe what you've done. For new programmers, this practice is excellent!"
