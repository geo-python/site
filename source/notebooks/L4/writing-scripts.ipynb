    "# Writing our scripts the \"right\" way\n",
    "\n",
    "The script example for functions we have seen so far works, but one of the big advantages of using scripts is including features that make the code easier to read and understand.\n",
    "These include comments in the code, which explain what the code does, but are not executed when the code is run.\n",
    "As your scripts get longer and more complicated, features such as comments will become essential.\n",
    "Below are some suggestions to make sure your code is formatted nicely and easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inline comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Inline comments are comments within the code that explain what certain lines of the code do.\n",
    "To you, it may seem obvious how the code works, but if you share it with another person perhaps they will not feel the same way.\n",
    "This is particularly true when you start using scripts instead of Jupyter notebooks, where you might not feel you can include as much text describing your code.\n",
    "Because we want to teach you to code in an effective way, it is a very good idea to make your scripts as easy to read as possible for people.\n",
    "Consider the example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Finnish Meterological Institute observation station name and location data\n",
    "# Station name for the station in Kaivopuisto, Helsinki, Finland\n",
    "stationName = 'Helsinki Kaivopuisto'\n",
    "# Station latitude and longitude - Latitude is north, longitude is east\n",
    "stationLat = 60.15\n",
    "stationLong = 24.96\n",
    "# Print station name and location to the screen\n",
    "print(\"The\", stationName, \"station is located at\", stationLat, \"N,\", stationLong, \"E\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have provided a a bit more information about the data in this script by adding inline comments.\n",
    "Inline comments begin with a `#` (number sign or hash), and all characters that follow on that line will be ignored by Python.\n",
    "Adding comments to scripts is essential for scientists like ourselves to both help us remember how a script works and to make it easier to share with colleagues.\n",
    "It is best to get into the habit of adding comments as you write, especially if you're not using a Jupyter notebook."
