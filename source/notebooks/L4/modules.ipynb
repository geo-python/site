    "## What is a module?\n",
    "\n",
    "A *module* in Python is simply a Python `.py` file that contains a list of related functions that can be loaded and used.\n",
    "Modules are similar to what are more generally called libraries in programming languages, which again contain code related to a specific task such as mathematical operations.\n",
    "There are a *HUGE* number of Python modules, and many of them greatly extend what can be done in a normal Python program.\n",
    "In fact, the abundance of free Python modules is one of the best reasons to learn and start using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can modules be loaded?\n",

    "Python modules can be loaded in a number of different ways.\n",
