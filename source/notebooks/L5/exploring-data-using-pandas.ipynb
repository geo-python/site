    "# Exploring data using Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first task in this week's lesson is to learn how to **read and explore data files in Python**. We will focus on using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) which is an open-source package for data analysis in Python. Pandas is an excellent toolkit for working with **real world data** that often have a tabular structure (rows and columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first get familiar with **pandas data structures**: *DataFrame* and *Series*:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Pandas data structures](img/pandas-structures.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pandas DataFrame** (a 2-dimensional data structure) is used for storing and mainpulating table-like data (data with rows and columns) in Python. You can think of pandas DataFrame as a programmable spreadsheet. \n",
    "- **Pandas Series** (a 1-dimensional data structure) is used for storing and manipulating an sequence of values. Pandas Series is kind of like a list, but more clever. One row or one column in a Pandas DataFrame is actually a Pandas Series. \n",
    "\n",
    "These Pandas structures incorporate a number of things we've already encountered, such as indices, data stored in a collection, and data types. Let's have another look at the Pandas data structures below with some additional annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Pandas data structures annotated](img/pandas-structures-annotated.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, both DataFrames and Series in pandas have an index that can be used to select values, but they also have column labels to identify columns in DataFrames. In the lesson this week we'll use many of these features to explore real-world data and learn some useful data analysis procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a comprehensive overview of pandas data structures you can have a look at Chapter 5 in Wes MacKinney's book [Python for Data Analysis (2nd Edition, 2017)](https://geo-python.github.io/site/course-info/resources.html#books) and [Pandas online documentation about data structures](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html).\n",

    "Pandas is a \"high-level\" package, which means that it makes use of several other packages, such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), in the background. There are several ways in which data can be read from a file in Python, and this year we have decided to focus primarily on pandas because it is easy-to-use, efficient and intuitive. If you are curoius about other approaches for interacting with data files, you can find lesson materials from previous years about reading data using [NumPy](https://geo-python.github.io/site/2018/notebooks/L5/numpy/1-Exploring-data-using-numpy.html#Reading-a-data-file-with-NumPy) or [built-in Python functions](https://geo-python.github.io/site/2017/lessons/L5/reading-data-from-file.html). \n",
