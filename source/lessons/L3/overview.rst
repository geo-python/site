Lesson overview
===============

This week we will focus on making decisions and repeating tasks in Python.
Both of these concepts are part of the larger computing idea called *control flow*, which refers to how the execution of different parts of a computer program is determined.
We will learn how to alter the execution of our scripts using (1) *loops*, which are used to repeat execution of parts of a program, and (2) *conditional statements*, which use basic logical tests to determine which parts of a program will be run.
The main components of today's lesson can be found in the navigation bar to the left.

Learning goals
--------------

After this weeks lesson your should be able to:

- Create a ``for`` loop and use it to repeat a section of code
- Use ``if``, ``elif``, and ``else`` statements to make decisions in your programs
- Explain how values can be compared using comparison operators
