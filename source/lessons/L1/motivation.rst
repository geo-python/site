Motivation for the course
=========================

The main part of the first half of this course is to learn to program in Python.
However, in addition to learning to program, we hope to help you learn a number of other skills related to open science.
These include:

1. Writing programs that are easy to understand and share
2. Keeping a log of the changes you make to your programs
3. Creating programs that ensure your science is reproducible
4. Producing simple, effective data visualizations that make your results accessible and easy to understand
