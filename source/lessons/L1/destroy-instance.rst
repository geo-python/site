Destroy instance after you have finished working
================================================

Save your work to your GitHub account
-------------------------------------

After you're done with your work it is **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT** that you
save your codes and work permanently to your GitHub account. If you
haven't done so before destroying the instance, **ALL YOUR WORK WILL BE
LOST!**

Why are we doing this? The first and biggest motivation is to encourage
and push you to learn how to use version control software (i.e., Git +
GitHub), which is extremely useful concept in many ways. The second
reason is a more practical one: at the moment there is no way to
permanently store your codes and data to the cloud computing environment
that we are using in this course.

We will not be saving anything to the
`GitHub.com <https://www.github.com>`__ site this week, but in the
future you can refer to the `instructions for using
GitHub <intro-to-github.md>`__.

Destroy the computer instance
-----------------------------

After saving your work to GitHub, destroy the instance by following
these steps:

1. Login to `your Computing Dashboard <https://pb.geo.helsinki.fi>`__
2. Destroy the running instance by pressing **Destroy** button

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: The Computer Instance will destroy itself
automatically after it's life-time (6 hours) has run out. Be sure to
save your work before instance is terminated.
