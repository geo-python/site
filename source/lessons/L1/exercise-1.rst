.. admonition:: Deadline

    Please complete this exercise **by the start of the next lesson**.

The exercise for this week has three parts. First, you will **create an account on GitHub.com**. Next, you will
**let us know your GitHub username via Slack**. Finally, you will **cook up some Python** using the skills you learned during the first lesson!

Part 1 - Sign up to GitHub

Part 2 - Slack

*This part is only for registered students. We have sent an invite link to Slack to all registered participants before the first lesson.*
*Please contact the course instructors via email in case you are registered for the course, but don't have access to Slack.*

1. Go to our **Slack** page at `geopython2020.slack.com <geopython2020.slack.com>`__.
2. **Post a new message** in the `#week-1 <https://geo-python-2020.slack.com/archives/C018Z51GKNG>`__ channel with
your **full name, GitHub username, course code** (GEOK_3030 or GEOG-329-1).

For example,``Dave Whipp, davewhipp, GEOK_3030`` or ``Vuokko Heikinheimo, VuokkoH, GEOG-329-1`` (please use comma to separate the different parts).
This will help us know you were able to create your account, that you have also figured out how to use Slack,
and we'll know who is who on GitHub :).

Students from other universities; you can add the name of your home institution (Aalto / Turku / Oulu) in stead of the course code like this;
``Tua Nylén, tuanylen, Turku``.

.. note::

    In case you're curious, we need your GitHub user name in order to access your exercise repositories in GitHub
    for grading and feedback.

.. admonition:: Start your assignment

    **You can start working on your copy of Exercise 1 by** `accepting the GitHub Classroom assignment <https://classroom.github.com/a/8GzFdvOv>`__.


1. Start the coding exercise by accepting the GitHub classroom assignment.
2. Read the instructions from the repository.
3. Launch a new JupyterLab instance from the launch button above. *You can use either binder or CSC Notebooks.*
4. Cook up some python according to the instructions!  *Remember to save your work ;) !*
5. Download your solution, and upload it to GitHub.com into your personal Exercise-1 repository.

*This week, we upload the exercise manually to GitHub. Next week, you will learn how to pull and push the exercises directly from GitHub to Jupyter Lab using Git!*

.. note::

    Each week, you will create a personal copy of the exercise repository on GitHub.com by clicking on the GitHub classroom link.

    You can also take a look at the template repository on GitHub: https://github.com/geo-python-2020/exercise-1
    Note that you are only able to make changes in your personal repository generated via GitHub Classroom.

Summary (what to submit)
-------------------------

1. Post a message in the `#week-1 <https://geo-python-2020.slack.com/archives/C018Z51GKNG>`__ channel at `geopython2020.slack.com <https://geopython2020.slack.com>`__ with your name, GitHub username and course.
2. Accept Exercise-1 in Github classroom and upload the jupyter notebook (file name should be `Exercise-1.ipynb`) containing your solutions for Part 2.

We ask that you complete this exercise by **the start of the next lesson**.
