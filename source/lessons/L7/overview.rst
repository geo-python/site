Lesson overview
===============

This week we will introduce you to data visualization and some different modules that can be used to make data plots in Python.
You can create simple plots directly from `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__, for example, but in order to control many aspects of those plots we need to also know how to use the plotting module called `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`__.
Matplotlib is an extremely powerful and flexible plotting module, as you will see.

Learning goals

After this weeks lesson your should be able to:

- Make basic *x*-*y* plots of data using pandas/Matplotlib
- Manipulate plot formatting
- Create plots in Jupyter notebooks and/or save them as image files
