Summary of early course feedback
================================

1. Is the pace of the lessons too fast, too slow, or about right?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Seems to be about right for most of the students.
-  Too quick for some, too slow for some others.

2. Is the content of the lessons too simple, too difficult, or about right?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Seems to be about right for many.
-  Students with earlier programming experience feel it a bit simple.
-  Some topics have been more challenging than others.

3. Is the content of the exercises too simple, too difficult, or about right?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  About right for many
-  A bit challenging for some and time consuming (especially Flag
   exercise was challenging)
-  Too simple for some
-  The difficult level of the exercises has varied a bit
-  Could be more examples
-  Could be more difficult exercises as optional tasks

4. Which aspect(s) of the course is/are most helpful to you?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Lessons
-  Exercises
-  Learning how to do programming (in Python) and how computers work
-  Learning GitHub

5. Which aspect(s) of the course is/are least helpful to you?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Mostly everything have been seen as useful
-  Lessons / Practical sessions / going through the basics
-  Using GitHub can be annoying and difficult to find materials

6. What suggestions do you have for improving this course?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  More time to do the exercises (e.g. 4 hour practicals or two 2-hour
   sessions)
-  Explaining correct answers on Monday / Giving right answers
-  Make it slightly more challenging
-  More instructions for the exercises, more examples, slightly easier
   exercises
-  *Chat for asking questions from others / teachers*
-  More stuff on Geographical issues
-  Optional more demanding exercise

7. Do you have any other general comments about the course? Comments on things like the computing environment or use of GitHub would be quite helpful!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  GitHub was first confusing but now I'm getting it!
-  *Why do we need to use computer instances / Pouta environment instead
   of doing stuff on local computers?*
-  *Why don't we use Moodle instead of GitHub?*
-  *Why isn't this course done as a MOOC?*
-  Give answers to the exercises
-  *More hints about programming practices (run and test your code
   frequently, don't use spaces in variable names etc.)*
-  *At the end of lesson material page, give link to the next page,
   previous page, main page*
-  Practicals should be in the same classroom as lectures where there
   are two screens
