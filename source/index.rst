Welcome to Geo-Python 2017!
================================================

.. figure:: img/GISflowchart.png


This course will introduce you the basics of programming and automatization of GIS-processes in the Python programming language.

Materials have been tailored for the further education course *Paikkatiedon käyttö ja hyödyntäminen* F.E.C. organized by `HY+ <http://hyplus.helsinki.fi/>`_.

The course consists of interactive lectures and exercises. All course material will be distributed via these pages. Materials are based on previous further education courses and two more extensive course packages: `Python for geo-people <https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people/Course-information>`_ and `Automating GIS-processes <https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2016/>`_ developed at the `Department of Geosciences and Geography <http://www.helsinki.fi/geo/english/index.html>`_, University of Helsinki.


Course schedule:
-----------------

The course is divided into three blocks. During the first days of the course,
we will learn the basics of python. During the last days of the course we will apply the basic skills
using the ArcPy-model for automating GIS-processes. Here is the preliminary schedule for the course
(might be subject to changes depending on how fast we proceed as a group!)
